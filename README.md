Resume
======

My resume in the markdown'ish format.  

__Notes:__
  - Resume has markers in it ({Street}, {City}, etc). Markers will be substituted with the real information from the AddressBook (OS X).
  - ./AddressBook - simple project for reading the AddressBook.
  - If information substitution is not working properly, check that you have a card selected in Address Book (menu "Card/Make this my Card")

__Todo:__
  - Add MS Word support
  - (good-to-have) Create short and long versions of resume
  - Python and tons of libs installed via Brew is too much... find a simpler way (phantomjs?).
